A full-stack web application built with Spring Boot and vanilla JavaScript that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. This project demonstrates a solid understanding of backend development with Java and Spring, frontend interaction with REST APIs, and database management with MySQL.
